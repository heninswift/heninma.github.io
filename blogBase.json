Huawei has achieved comprehensive and significant results in the R&D of 5G communications, smartphone operating systems (using self-made and domestically collaborated high-performance chips: 7nm/5nm), computing power (single-chip and integrated computing power), and generative large language models. Huawei's Ascend 910B chip has a performance of 376 TFLOPS, close to NVIDIA's A100 level, while the 910C offers 60% of the H100's computing power, but with 40% higher power consumption than the H100. Huawei's executive director Zhang Pingan stated: 'Huawei's innovation direction does not focus on the manufacturing process of a single chip but on innovative system architecture for chips, fully utilizing the advantages of bandwidth and energy.' NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said that Huawei is NVIDIA's strongest challenger. Huawei's Cloud Matrix 384 computing cluster solution (using 384 910C chips) improves cluster efficiency by 67% through high-speed bus interconnection and memory pooling, delivering a computing power of 300 PFLOPS, which is twice that of NVIDIA's GB200NVL72 system. Recently, during a conversation with reporters from the People's Daily, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei mentioned that the U.S. has exaggerated Huawei's achievements, and Huawei is not that powerful yet, asserting that they must strive to reach that level. Our single chip still lags behind the U.S. by one generation; we use mathematics to supplement physics, non-Moore to supplement Moore, and collective computing to complement single chips, achieving practical results.\n\n2. A batch of high-quality generative autoregressive language models has emerged. \u2460 The Tongyi Qianwen Qwen3 mixed reasoning open-source large model developed by Alibaba's MoDa community features its flagship model Qwen3-235B-A22B along with 8 other large models, whose performance has temporarily surpassed DeepSeekR1 and OpenAIo1, officially reaching the top of the global open-source large model throne! \u2461 The Xiaomi MiMo reasoning open-source large model, in the realm of lower parameters, MiMo-7B has surpassed OpenAIo1-mini and Alibaba's Qwen reasoning model QwQ-32B-Preview, showcasing its potential as a leading starting model in the industry for reinforcement learning.\n\n3. The Super Agent CO-Sight developed by ZTE Corporation has topped the international authority Agent GAIA benchmark test, outperforming the four international giants: Google's DeepMind Langfun Agent, Microsoft (+OpenAI) Aworld, MIT's Infant Agent, and Meta's OWL-Workforce, ranking first! It has sparked the next wave of AI (the 'World Model').\n\n\n4. The sixth generation semiconductor display's ultra-high pixel frontier technology and production line was developed by BOE, featuring ultra-high pixel density (2.24 inches with 1700 pixels), breaking existing strongholds, and establishing the world's most advanced sixth generation new semiconductor display device production line with mass production capabilities. \n\n5. COPU organized a dozen companies to develop AIOS. AIOS comes in two types: \u2460 one that starts with applications to integrate intelligent modules into the OS, and \u2461 one that starts with architecture or kernel to develop fully intelligent AIOS.\n\n\n\u5171\u5efa\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\n\u5171\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\n\uff08\u5f00\u6e90\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8f6c\u578b\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u91cd\u6784\uff09\n\uff08COPU\u540d\u8a89\u4e3b\u5e2d\u9646\u9996\u7fa4\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u5c4a\u5f00\u6e90\u4e2d\u56fd\u5f00\u6e90\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u62a5\u544a\uff09\n\n\u4e00\u3001\u534e\u4e3a\uff0c\u57285G\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u5236\u53ca\u56fd\u5185\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u82af\u7247\uff1a7nm/5nm\uff09\uff0c\u7b97\u529b\uff08\u5355\u82af\u7247\u548c\u7b97\u529b\u96c6\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u3001\u91cd\u5927\u7684\u6210\u679c\u534e\u4e3a\u6607\u817e\u82af\u7247910B=376TFLOPS\u63a5\u8fd1\u82f1\u4f1f\u8fbeA100\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c910C\u4e3aH100\u7b97\u529b\u768460%\uff0c\u4f46\u529f\u8017\u9ad8\u51faH100\u768440%\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1751163999, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-06-29", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Blog Title", "faviconUrl": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://heninswift.github.io/heninma.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
